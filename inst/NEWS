Changes in version 0.0.6 (2016-07-07)
========================

* Fixed bug when using plot functionality of filtering functions.
* "Conditional" pam replaced with "Stratified" pam, clustering each bio-cross-batch condition separately, rather than simply each bio condition.
* Added option to write normalized matrices to HDF5 file.
* Added wrapper function get_normalized() to retrieve normalized data.

Changes in version 0.0.5
========================

* Modified biplot to handle general coloring schemes.
* Limit number of WV and UV factors to eval_pcs in computing WV and UV scores.
* Updated dependencies.
* Added error-handling to sample filter.
* Removed “var preserved” measure do to length of running time.

Changes in version 0.0.4
========================

* Fixed a few bugs and documentation mismatches.
* Removed stability evaluation (redundant with sil width and slow).
* Removed clusterExperiment dependency.
* Removed RUV correlation score. UV correlation now takes ruv control genes as default.
* Added RLE measures to scone evaluation.
* Added FQT_FN to implement careful ties handling by FQ.
* Better handling of plots in sample filter functions.
* Mean score rather than median rank to evaluate normalizations.
* Default value for imputation.
* Minor optimizations to evaluation functions.

Changes in version 0.0.3
========================

* Fixed various bugs.
* Added “compactness” measure for stability evaluation.
* Compute RUV factors only when needed.
* Fixed Github issues #11, #12, #13, #14, #21, #28.
* zinb now works for non-integer whole numbers.
* Updated tests.
* Added documentation for datasets.
* Added biplot_colored function.
