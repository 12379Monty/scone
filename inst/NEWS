Changes in version 0.0.5
========================
* Modified biplot to handle general coloring schemes.
* Limit number of WV and UV factors to eval_pcs in computing WV and UV scores.

Changes in version 0.0.4
========================

* Fixed a few bugs and documentation mismatches
* Removed stability evaluation (redundant with sil width and slow)
* Removed clusterExperiment dependency
* Removed RUV correlation score. UV correlation now takes ruv control genes as default
* Added RLE measures to scone evaluation
* Added FQT_FN to implement careful ties handling by FQ
* Better handling of plots in sample filter functions
* Mean score rather than median rank to evaluate normalizations
* Default value for imputation
* Minor optimizations to evaluations

Changes in version 0.0.3
========================

* Fixed various bugs
* Added compactness measure for stability evaluation
* Compute RUV factors only when needed
* Fixed Github issues #11, #12, #13, #14, #21, #28
* zinb now works for non-integer whole numbers
* Updated tests
* Added documentation for datasets
* Added biplot_colored function
